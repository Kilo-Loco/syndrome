## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/syndrome.git
cd syndrome

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/xamrock/syndrome.git

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Build the package
swift build

# Run all tests
swift test

# Run specific tests
swift test --filter YourTestName

# Build documentation
swift package generate-documentation
```

### Coding Standards

#### Swift Style Guide

- Use Swift's official API Design Guidelines
- Indent with 4 spaces (no tabs in code)
- Maximum line length of 120 characters
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Document all public APIs with doc comments

#### Code Organization

```swift
// MARK: - Properties
// Group related properties together

// MARK: - Initialization
// Initializers

// MARK: - Public Methods
// Public API

// MARK: - Private Methods
// Internal implementation
```

#### Documentation

```swift
/// Parses a Markdown string into a document structure.
///
/// This method processes the input text through two phases:
/// 1. Block-level parsing to identify structure
/// 2. Inline parsing within each block
///
/// - Parameter markdown: The Markdown text to parse
/// - Returns: A `MarkdownDocument` containing the parsed elements
/// - Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input
public static func parse(_ markdown: String) -> MarkdownDocument {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Testing Guidelines

#### Test Structure

```swift
@Suite("Feature Name Tests")
struct FeatureTests {
    @Test("Should handle basic case")
    func testBasicCase() {
        let input = "test input"
        let expected = ExpectedOutput()
        let result = MarkdownParser.parse(input)
        #expect(result == expected)
    }
    
    @Test("Should handle edge case")
    func testEdgeCase() {
        // Test implementation
    }
}
```

#### Test Coverage

- Aim for >90% code coverage
- Test both happy paths and edge cases
- Include tests for error conditions
- Add performance tests for critical paths
